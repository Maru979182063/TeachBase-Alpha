# Worktree Compartments 2026-08-04

This report separates current dirty worktree changes into review compartments.
All paths are relative git paths; no local absolute path is part of the reproducible input contract.

## Counts

- `foundation_hardening`: 1

## Commit Handling

- commit final_chain_registry files separately from foundation_hardening files
- do not include validation_report_refresh files unless intentionally updating generated reports
- review mixed_control_file changes line-by-line before staging

## Records

- ` M` `foundation_hardening` `docs/reports/foundation_hardening_test_report_20260803.json`: artifact atomicity or model retry/checkpoint hardening
